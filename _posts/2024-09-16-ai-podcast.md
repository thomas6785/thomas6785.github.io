Back in April I had the privilege of joining two peers, Thomas Doyle and Tara Cullinane, in a studio in UCD to record a 30 minute podcast about the future of AI in education. The podcast finally went public today and you can [hear it on UCD's website](https://www.ucd.ie/eacollege/study/bridgesandbytesthestudentvoiceonaiandassessment/) (episode 1: Closed Book Exams).

Huge thanks to Eoin Ryan and Cathal Ó Gréagóir who researched, wrote, and produced the show with us, and to Jennifer Keenahan and Mairáad O'Reilly who spearheaded the initiative. I had an amazing time and would probably consider recording more podcasts in future.
