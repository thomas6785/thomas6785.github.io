Three years ago, I tried designing and writing a chess engine from scratch, which I nicknamed Engie. I went through a few iterations and frustrated restarts before I finally got a working model. Though did complete a prototype that could play against a beginner, but it was more than a little buggy.

I never really considered the project 'finished', and it's always bothered me, so I'd like to revisit it (hopefully now as a better developer), and make note of new development here. I'll be starting from scratch and try to update this whenever I can. I'm kicking this project off just as the new college year begins, so progress may be inconsistent.

I'll be writing in Python (despite how slow it is) and, to begin with, I'll try to rely as little as possible on external ideas and strategies for developing chess engines.
