title: Card Shuffling Simulation
layout: post

I simulated shuffling a deck of cards using the <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/bayer_diaconis.pdf">Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds model</a> and found some interesting results. Though the paper recommends seven riffle shuffles generally being enough, I simulated 50,000 decks and found that the card initially on the bottom of the deck had a 52% chance of still being in the lower half of the deck after seven riffles.<br/>

No amount of riffle shuffling can ever fully eliminate the 'traces' of the original deck.<br/>
<br/>
Further analysis to be done:<ul>
<li>Through simulation or analysis, find a 52x52 matrix that shows how likely each card is to end up in each other positions after a riffle. Exponentiating this matrix could give a picture of how likely a card is to be in certain parts of the deck, a useful tool for analysis.</li>
<li>Consider the effect of larger decks of cards. How many shuffles are needed?</li>
<li>Evaluate the effectiveness of introducing overhand shuffles. Intuitively, it seems that employing a mixture of overhand and riffle shuffling would be most effective (overhand for 'bulk' randomisation, riffling to split nearby cards).</li>
</ul>
