			<h2>17/09/2024 Card Shuffling Simulation</h2>
			I simulated shuffling a deck of cards using the <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/bayer_diaconis.pdf">Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds model</a> and found some interesting results. Though the paper recommends seven riffle shuffles generally being enough, I simulated 50,000 decks and found that the card initially on the bottom of the deck had a 52% chance of still being in the lower half of the deck after seven riffles.<br/>
			<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="resources/card_shuffling_overview.png" width="100%"/><br/></div>
			No amount of riffle shuffling can ever fully eliminate the 'traces' of the original deck.<br/>
			<br/>
			Further analysis to be done:<ul>
			<li>Through simulation or analysis, find a 52x52 matrix that shows how likely each card is to end up in each other positions after a riffle. Exponentiating this matrix could give a picture of how likely a card is to be in certain parts of the deck, a useful tool for analysis.</li>
			<li>Consider the effect of larger decks of cards. How many shuffles are needed?</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>16/09/2024 Podcast Published with UCD on AI in Education</h2>
			Back in April I had the privilege of joining two peers, Thomas Doyle and Tara Cullinane, in a studio in UCD to record a 30 minute podcast about the future of AI in education. The podcast finally went public today and you can <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/eacollege/study/bridgesandbytesthestudentvoiceonaiandassessment/">hear it on UCD's website</a> (episode 1: Closed Book Exams).<br/>
			<br/>
			Huge thanks to Eoin Ryan and Cathal Ó Gréagóir who researched, wrote, and produced the show with us, and to Jennifer Keenahan and Mairáad O'Reilly who spearheaded the initiative. I had an amazing time and would probably consider recording more podcasts in future.
