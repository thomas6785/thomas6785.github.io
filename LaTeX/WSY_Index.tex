\section{Introduction}
Dr. Declan Delaney

\subsection{Motivation}
\begin{outline}[enumerate]
\1 Signals travel without wires
    \2 In this module, signals travel as radio waves\\
    (optical and acoustic systems ignored)
\1 Applications are mostly in communications
    \2 Signals modulated to carry information
    \2 Many familiar applications such as radar, navigation, etc.
\end{outline}

\begin{framed}
Example: Modern smart phone has approximately 9 distinct wireless systems. Try identifying them?
\begin{outline}[enumerate]
    % TODO remove the gaps between these examples and make it more compact
\1 NFC
\1 Cellulars
    \2 2G
    \2 3G
    \2 4G
    \2 5G
\1 GPS
\1 Bluetooth
\1 WiFi
\1 UWB
\1 Lidar
\end{outline}

\textbf{Advantages of Wireless}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mobility
\item Good for one-to-many transmission
\item High-capacity point-to-point links (cheaper than wired) (e.g. to serve remote areas)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantages of Wired}
\begin{itemize}
\item Very little leakage
\item No interference
\item Multiple systems can operate adjacently without issue
\end{itemize}
but wired has much, much larger overheads.\\
Wired used for super high capacity lines (eg. fibre-optic transatlantic cables)

\subsection{The Wireless Spectrum}
The EM spectrum is a shared and limited resource.\\
Mostly regulated by government agencies.
